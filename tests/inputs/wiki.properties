# The key characters =, and : should be written with

# However, there is no need to precede the value characters =, and : by a backslash.

# But if the number of backslashes at the end of the line is even, the next line is not included in the value. In the following example, the value for "key" is "valueOverOneLine\"
key = valueOverOneLine\\
# This line is not included in the value for "key"
# Add spaces to the key
key\ with\ spaces = This is the value that could be looked up with the key "key with spaces".
# The characters = and : in the key must be escaped as well:
key\:with\=colonAndEqualsSign = This is the value for the key "key:with=colonAndEqualsSign"

# If you want your property to include a backslash, it should be escaped by another backslash
