This is a bug-fix release to solve mis-handling of git inputs for
straight counts in 1.78 (--git --diff works ok in 1.78),
https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc/issues/328.

New Languages:
    o ReasonML

Updates:
    o New SQL output style option with "--sql-style Named_Columns".  This
      includes the table "t" column names in each insert statement.
    o New option --file-encoding to create all output files using the
      given file encoding (for example "--file-encoding
    o Add escript as script language for Erlang.
    o Improved handling of custom Smarty definitions through
      --read-lang-def.
    o Better diff logic when comparing two files.
    o Faster program start on the Unix-tuned version of cloc when

    o Igor Pro
    o JSON5
    o Nix
    o R Markdown
    o SparForte
    o Xtend

Updates:
    o Interpret "--diff-timeout 0" as allowing unlimited time to compute
      diffs.
    o Add .inl extension for C++
    o Improve language rules for Assembly and JCL.
    o Better handling of OCaml comments (don't just use Pascal rules).
    o Handle unusual file names with --use-sloccount.
    o Remove GNU grep specific -P option with --use-sloccount (fall back
      to simpler BSD grep options).
    o Handle OCaml nested comments.
    o Remove debug print statement for counts of Rmd (R markdown) files.
    o New switch --include-ext to only count files with the given extension.
    o New switch --config to load command line switches from a file.
    o New switch --hide-rate to suppress header line (makes the output
      deterministic).
    o Skip header line when combining diff reports.
    o Allow any number (including just one) of diff reports to be summed.
    o Exit early if --diff arguments are the same.
    o New switch --strip-str-comments to (try to) avoid 'Complex regular
      subexpression recursion limit' warning.
    o Run cleanly under Perl 5.28 and 5.32 by backslashing braces in regex.
    o Suppord Idris block comments.
    o Set UTF-8 encoding on XML and XSL files generated by cloc.
    o New switch --write-lang-def-incl-dup to include files with extension 
      collisions (but should be used with care because the resulting language
      definition file will be rejected by cloc until all collisions have been
      resolved).

Bug Fixes:
    o Correctly handle --not-match-d and --follow-links together.
    o Fix --git --diff handling of large file sets.
    o Remove \$ from git pathspec filename-cleansing regex as git already
      handles such filename mangling
    o Remove debug die() invocation in make_file_list().
    o Fix improperly formatted JSON emitted with --by-file-by-lang.
    o Improve accuracy of C#/Smalltalk disambuguator (was biased toward
      counting .cs files as Smalltalk).
    o Improve accuracy of TypeScript/Qt Linguist disambuguator.
    o More robust YAML output by quoting file and language names.
    o Handle more unusual file names with --git --diff

      --read_lang_def.
    o Add SUM section to JSON, YAML output with --diff.

                Release Notes for cloc version 1.68
                   https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc
                             June 3, 2016

New Languages:
    o Blade
    o Brainfuck
    o builder
    o Clean
    o INI
    o JSX
    o liquid
    o Logtalk
    o Markdown
    o Mathematica
    o Pug
    o Qt Linguist
    o Slim
    o TTCN

Updates:
    o --help output now goes to STDOUT instead of STDERR.
    o Shortened cloc's output header line by removing "https:" from the
      github repository URL.
    o Add block comment support to CoffeeScript.
    o Improve Coq/Verilog disambiguator by recognizing more Coq keywords.
    o Improve handling of HAML block comments.
    o Improve Pascal/Puppet disambiguator.
    o Improve Perl/Prolog disambiguator by recognizing Perl HERE documents.
    o Add .cuh extension for CUDA.
    o Add .hxx extension for C/C++ header files.
    o Associate .mk extension with make.

New options and features:

    --use-sloccount           If SLOCCount is installed, use its compiled
                              executables c_count, java_count, pascal_count,
                              php_count, and xml_count instead of cloc's
                              counters.  SLOCCount's compiled counters are
                              substantially faster than cloc's and may give
                              a performance improvement when counting projects
                              with large files.  However, these cloc-specific
                              features will not be available: --diff,
                              --count-and-diff, --strip-comments, --unicode.
     --vcs=<VCS>              Invoke a system call to <VCS> to obtain a list of
                              files to work on.  If <VCS> is 'git', then will
                              invoke 'git ls-files'.  If <VCS> is 'svn' then
                              will invoke 'svn list -R'.  The primary benefit
                              is that cloc will then skip files explicitly
                              excluded by the versioning tool in question,
                              ie, those in .gitignore or have the svn:ignore
                              property.
                              Alternatively <VCS> may be any system command
                              that generates a list of files.
                              Note:  cloc must be in a directory which can read
                              the files as they are returned by <VCS>.  cloc
                              will not download files from remote repositories.
                              'svn list -R' may refer to a remote repository
                              to obtain file names (and therefore may require
                              authentication to the remote repository), but
                              the files themselves must be local.
 

    o Handle .deb archive files on Unix-like operating systems that have
      the Debian 'dpkg-deb' command.  This is only useful for counting
      lines in Debian packages that contain source code--most contain
      only compiled executables.

Bug Fixes:
    o Updated documentation for --exclude-dir to prohibit path separators.
    o Correct file path normalization problem when directory contains
      trailing slash.
    o --list-file:  Return an empty list if the file cannot be read.
    o --exclude-dir:  correctly handle command line input consisting of a 
      file with leading directory names, eg abc/def/hello.c, by first
      checking that parent directories aren't in exclusion list.
    o Expand behavior of --fullpath to also work with --not-match-d.
    o Split into two statements expressions like "scalar(split(..))"
      which are deprecated in Perl 5.22.
    o --sum-reports: Give a useful error message when encountering an unknown 
      language during report summation.

Updates:
    o Add block comment support to CoffeeScript.
    o .xhtml is no longer associated with JavaServer Faces; instead
      it is counted as XHTML
    o Remove association of .config to ASP.Net (.config is too
      general to be appropriated by one language).
    o Support .hlsl extension for HLSL.
    o Changes to support Perl v5.22:
      * Remove references to deprecated "defined(@array)".
      * Remove "no warnings 'deprecated'" as it is no longer needed.
    o Greater reliance on Regexp::Common's C++ regex instead of
      using internal // filter.
    o Update code pulled from Regexp::Common 2.120 to 2013031301.
    o Support .f and .for extensions for Forth and disambiguate
      between Fortran and Forth.
    o Better output with --explain for languages that share file
      extensions.
    o Ignore .o.cmd files as they are Linux kernel compilation
      optimization files.
    o Add .kts extension for Kotlin.
    o Add .cljc extension for ClojureC.
    o Add .ui extension for Qt.
    o Support php and php5 as #! scripting languages.

New options and features:

   --json                    Write the results as JavaScript Object Notation
                             (JSON) formatted output.
   --fullpath                Modifies the behavior of --match-f or
                             --not-match-f to include the file's path
                             in the regex, not just the file's basename.
                             (This does not expand each file to include its
                             absolute path, instead it uses as much of
                             the path as is passed in to cloc.)
   --md                      Write the results as Markdown-formatted text.
   --verbose                 Synonym for -v.


Bug Fixes:
    o Don't write language definition for "(unknown)" (via --write-lang-def).
    o Fix length of hyphen line with --sum-reports. 
    o Fix uninitialized variable bug when --explain is given an unknown
      language.
    o Force files ending with .smarty to be counted as Smarty (unless over-
      ridden by --force-lang=X).
    o Fix hash reference bug triggered with '--csv --by-percent' combination .
    o Correctly recognize R files on Windows.

    o Extend Assembly filters to include !, |, @, --.
    o Add for, FOR, ftn, FTN extensions for Fortran 77.

    o Change --sql schema by adding fields File_dirname, File_basename to 
      table 't' of SQL output to simplify obtaining per-directory metrics

    o Improved language detection for Objective C (earlier misidentified
      as MATLAB or other .m languages).
    o Sort duplicate file lists by full path instead of basename to give
      repeatable output.
    o Change SQL schema 'text' type to more standard 'varchar(500)'.
    o Added .gradle extension for Groovy.
    o Better handling of files ending with .d (could be Linux init scripts).
    o Added .robot extension for RobotFramework.
    o Support Python unicode docstrings, patch by <clemens@kaposi.name>.
    o Ignore line ending styles when diff'ing Windows and Unix files.

                           Patch by Ryan Lindeman.

   --by-percent  X         Instead of comment and blank line counts, show
                           these values as percentages based on the value
                           of X in the denominator:

                           For example, if using method 'c' and your code
                           has twice as many lines of comments as lines
                           of code, the value in the comment column will
                           be 200%.  The code column remains a line count.
                           Patch by Ryan Lindeman.

   --sql-style=<style>     Write SQL statements in the given style instead
                           of the default SQLite format.  Currently, the
                           only style option is Oracle.


Bug Fixes:
    o Added a more sophisticated method to align top level directories
      for --diff.
    o Fixes XML output when running with --sum-reports and --xml so the
      .lang file ends with <languages/> and the .file file ends with
      <files/> (previously both ended with <languages/>).
    o Fix logig error when handling HAML block comments.
    o Fix language filter for Groovy.
    o Fix some forward and backslash issues with file name parsing
      in Windows filenames during --diff.
    o Handle --exclude-file-list when running with --diff.
    o Fix regex error for detecting double extensions (eg .sproc.sql)

                   http://cloc.sourceforge.net
                           July 29 2014

Updates:
    o JSP             Added extension  .jspf
    o MSBuild script  Added extensions .vcproj, .wixproj, .vbproj
    o DOS Batch       Added extensions .cmd, .btm
    o C++             Added extension  .c++
    o Pascal          Lines that begin with {! are counted as code as
                      some compilers treat these as a compiler directives.
    o Lisp            Treat text between #| and |# as a block comment.
    o Suppress progress rate display if --quiet is set.
    o --exclude-dir directories are pruned before the file search 
      descends into those directories instead of just ignoring
      files there
    o The logic that aligns file pairs between --diff sets was 
      rewritten.  Corner cases such as diff between one file and
      a set of files are handled much more precisely.

New options and features:

   --explain=LANG            Print the filters used to remove comments for
                             language LANG and exit.  In some cases the 
                             filters refer to Perl subroutines rather than
                             regular expressions.  An examination of the
                             source code may be needed for further explanation.

   Added new filter macros:
      o remove_between_general, which accepts start and end comment marker.
      o remove_between_regex, which accepts start and end comment regexes.

   Properly handle text files that begin with Unicode Byte Order Marks.

Bug Fixes:

    Remove spurious newlines produced by bad comment removal regexes
    which could cause incorrect diff's.
    Correctly handle file extensions with non-alphanumeric characters.
    Show file count with --sum-reports.
    Properly encode characters &,<,>,",' in XML output.
    Properly read and write entries for the 'remove_between_general'
    macro in language definition text files.

                Release Notes for cloc version 1.60
                   http://cloc.sourceforge.net
                           August 16, 2013

New Languages:
    o LESS
    o Razor
    o JavaServer Faces
    o SASS
    o Apex Trigger
    o Visualforce Component
    o Visualforce Page
    o Verilog-SystemVerilog
    o Pig Latin

Updates:
    o Improved handling of UTF-16 (both little and big endian).
    o use Time::HiRes if available.
    o Improved logic that distinguishes between Objective C,
      MUMPS and MATLAB files.
    o Added information about duplicate files to output created
      by --ignored.
    o Added support for .tar.xz compressed archives.
    o CMake                Added .cmake file extension.
    o MXML                 Added support for Actionscript
    o Groovy               Added .gant file extension.
    o Vala                 Recognize Vala header files.

New options and features:

   --max-file-size=<MB>      Skip files larger than <MB> megabytes when
                             traversing directories.  By default, <MB>=100.
                             cloc's memory requirement is roughly twenty times 
                             larger than the largest file so running with 
                             files larger than 100 MB on a computer with less 
                             than 2 GB of memory will cause problems.  
                             Note:  this check does not apply to files 
                             explicitly passed as command line arguments.

Bug Fixes:

    Suppress "Wrote <file>" messages when running with --quiet.
    Fixed an error that caused cloc to fail with "Can't use an 
    undefined value as an ARRAY reference" when running with 
    Perl 5.16 or newer when it encounters certain file types.

============================================================================
                Release Notes for cloc version 1.58
                   http://cloc.sourceforge.net
                           March 3, 2013

Version 1.58 introduces a new version numbering scheme:  odd numbers 
represent development versions while even numbers represent stable,
released versions.  There was no release 1.57 as it was the development
version leading to this release.

New Languages:
    o Ant
    o Arduino Sketch
    o InstallShield
    o Maven
    o PowerShell
    o Rust
    o Vala

Updates:
    o OCaml                Added extensions .mli, .mly, .mll
    o --read-lang-def      See the section --read-lang-def v. 
                           --force-lang-def below.

New options and features:

  --diff-timeout N
      o Running diff on large files with many repeated lines may
        cause Algorithm::Diff::sdiff() to run for hours.  This
        option sets the upper time limit on the duration of this
        operation for a single file pair.  Default is 10 seconds.

  --force-lang-def FILE
      o See the section --read-lang-def v. --force-lang-def below.

  --skip-archive REGEX
      o Ignore files that end with the given Perl regular expression.  
        For example, if given --skip-archive='(zip|tar(.(gz|Z|bz2|xz|7z))?)'
        the code will skip files that end with .zip, .tar, .tar.gz, 
        .tar.Z, .tar.bz2, .tar.xz, and .tar.7z (feature req. 32).

    Prevent "defined(@array) is deprecated" warnings with Perl 5.16.1.

    Show an example of alternation in the documentation for the --match-d
    switch.


--read-lang-def v. --force-lang-def
      
    The --read-lang-def option allows one to replace cloc's language
    processing filters with custom settings.  The problem with this
    option is that it overwrites internal logic that handles languages
    which map to the same file extension.  Currently these are
        MATLAB/Objective C/MUMPS   -> .m
        Pascal/PHP                 -> .inc
        Lisp/OpenCL                -> .cl
    The logic needed to handle these extension collisions is not
    easily expressed in an input text file.  In any event, in most
    instances one merely wishes to augment cloc's language definitions
    with entries for new languages rather than replace definitions
    for known languages.

    For this reason, the behavior of --read-lang-def has been changed
    to merge new language definitions found in the given file with
    cloc's existing languages.  Where there are conflicts, cloc's
    built-in definitions take precedence.  This new behavior allows
    one to add new language definitions without sacrificing cloc's
    ability to count files languages ending with .m, .inc, or .cl.

    The new option --force-lang-def behaves exactly like --read-lang-def
    did in cloc versions 1.56 and earlier--it completely ignores
    cloc's internal language definitions and replaces them with definitions
    in the given file.  However, one will no longer be able to count
    files with the extensions .m, .inc, or .cl.

Bug Fixes:

    Suppress "Wrote <file>" messages when running with --quiet.

    Create .file output when running with --sum-reports (id 3571353).

    Correct output for languages starting with a lower case letter when 
    running with --diff --sum-reports.

    Show correct count of files added/deleted with --diff (id 78).

    Handle special case of --diff between one file and a set of files (id 82).

    Prevent cloc from inadvertently counting lines from temporary
    installations of Algorithm::Diff and/or Regexp::Common.  This happens
    on faulty Perl installations (eg. MinGW MSYS Perl) which cause 
    File::Temp::tempdir() to return the current working directory.

============================================================================
                Release Notes for cloc version 1.56
                   http://cloc.sourceforge.net
                           April 3, 2012   

Version 1.56 introduces an additional documentation file, cloc.1.pod, which
can be used to produce cloc's documentation in the style of a Unix man page,
plain text, HTML, or LaTeX.

New Languages:
    o Clojure
    o ClojureScript
    o AutoHotkey
    o QML
    o CFScript
    o OpenCL

New options and features:

  --unix
      o Override the operating system autodetection logic and run in 
        UNIX mode.

  --windows
      o Override the operating system autodetection logic and run in 
        Microsoft Windows mode.

  --show-os
      o Print the name of the of the operating system mode and exit.

  --csv-delimiter
      o Use the provided delimiter instead of a comma when generating 
        csv output.

  --stdin-name
      o On UNIX systems, enables cloc to count code piped in via STDIN.
        This switch provides a filename for to use to infer the language.

  .git subdirectories are now ignored.

  Updated yacc counter to recognize C99 comments.

  Improved detection and reporting of ignored zero sized files.

  Removed spurious <languages> from YAML output.

  Fixed handling of multi-line Ruby comments surrounded by =begin/=end.

  Associated .ctl and .dsr extensions with Visual Basic

Bug Fixes:

  Produce correct diff results when comparing empty files with populated 
  files.

  Remove temporary directory names from --by-file output when working
  with archive files.

  Honor user's requested scratch directory if given --sdir.

============================================================================
                Release Notes for cloc version 1.55
                   http://cloc.sourceforge.net
                          October 14, 2011

Version 1.55 is a bugfix release to correct malformed XML output 
that was introduced in the 1.54 release.  Two minor enhancements
were added:

New Languages:
    o Dart

New options and features:

  --sum-one
      o Force printing of the SUM: line even if only one source
        file is counted.

============================================================================
                Release Notes for cloc version 1.54
                   http://cloc.sourceforge.net
                          October 1, 2011


New Languages:
    o CMake
    o Cython
    o Objective C++
    o Ocaml
    o Smarty

New options and features:

  --autoconf
      o Count files of recognized languages that end with ".in"
        (for example, code.h.in, Makefile.in) as used by GNU
        automake/autoconf.

  --match-d, --not-match-d
      o Include, or skip over, directories whose names match
        provided regular expressions.

  --follow-links
      o Follow symbolic links (on Unix-like OS's).

  YAML and XML output:  header lines now include the cloc URL,
  version, # lines and files counted, etc.

  YAML and XML output:  if writing to a file (rather than STDOUT),
  save the file name as an element inside the file.

  Include support for languages with double extensions.  First
  implementation of these uses .spc.sql for SQL Stored Procedures 
  and .data.sql as SQL Data as distinct from just SQL.

  Handle archive files (tar files, zip files, etc) with spaces
  in their names.

Bug Fixes:

  Lisp:  Include .lisp as a valid file extension.

  Correctly identify operating system as Windows if MKS Toolkit is 
  installed.

  Fix incorrectly handled .inc files (could be PHP or Pascal).

  --counted
      o Correct output to show only files which were actually
        used to produce the code count.  Also show the output
        by language rather than by filename.

  --diff
      o Fixed null output when one input has a single file while
        the comparison input has multiple files.
      o Fixed null output when no lines of code are modified in
        common files (only entire files were added or removed).
      o Handle cases where one of the two inputs is an empty
        file or directory.

  --diff + --exclude-file-list
      o --diff now skips files defined by --exclude-file-list

  --diff + --exclude-lang
      o --diff now skips languages defined by --exclude-lang

  --diff + --xml   
      o Include user-provided xsl file name in XML --diff output.
      o XML output for --by-file and --by-file-by-lang.
  
  --diff + --csv
      o Added comma separated value output for --diff.
  
  --diff + --sum-reports
      o Can now use the --sum-reports option with --diff.

  --exclude-dir
      o Quote metacharacters when comparing directory names against 
      --exclude-dir value.

  --strip-comments
      o Do not remove blank lines if they follow lines with
        (language-dependent) continuation markers.

  --sum-reports + --list-file
      o Allow the --sum-reports option to take its inputs from
        files defined by --list-file

Outstanding issues:
  --sql output formats remain unimplemented for --diff.

============================================================================
                Release Notes for cloc version 1.53
                   http://cloc.sourceforge.net

New Languages:
    o Go
    o MXML

New options:

  --lang-no-ext
      o Alternate method to count files without file
        extension.
  --ignore-case  
      o Works with --diff; treat uppercase and lowercase text
        as equivalent.

Bug Fixes:

  Pascal:  Add // as a comment marker.
  IDL:     Include .pro as a recognized file extension.

  --3:   
      o Correct XSLT syle when running with --3.
  
  --diff:   
      o Implemented YAML output option.
      o Implemented XML output option.  Includes an optional
        default XSLT style file.
      o Include code/comment/blank counts of added files to  
        total added material and include code/comment/blank
        counts of removed files to total removed material.
      o Ignore unrecognized languages.
  
  --exclude-ext
      o Was inadvertently disabled in v1.52; works now.

Outstanding issues:
  --csv, --sql output formats remain unimplemented for --diff.

============================================================================
                Release Notes for cloc version 1.52
                   http://cloc.sourceforge.net

New Languages:
    o Groovy
    o Scala
    o XAML

New options:

  --exclude-ext 
      o Ignore files with the given file extension.
  
  --ignore-whitespace  
      o Works with --diff; ignore whitespace in code and comments
        when computing differences.

Bug Fixes:

  Fortran:  Treat line starting with an exclamation mark as a comment.
  Cobol:    Treat page eject directive and any line with characters
            in columns 1-6 as a blank line.
  
  --diff:   
      o Fix negative value of removed blank lines.
      o Better output column alignment when running with --by-file.
      o Bug fixes when dealing with fully qualified Windows paths.
  
  --exclude-list-file  
      o Can now also include directories to ignore in the supplied 
        input file.

Other Improvements:
    o Better logic to select the file whose name identifies it as
      containing source code when the file is one of several having 
      identical contents (for example, if main.c and main.c.bak have
      identical contents, choose main.c for counting instead of 
      main.c.bak, which would be rejected because the filename
      does not match any recognized language).
    o Contents of .hg/ (Mercurial) directories are ignored.
    o On Windows: Ignore case in file name extensions.
